# Why Choose Split Stack?

Selecting the right web development stack is a crucial decision, and Split stacks offers compelling reasons to be your top choice. Here's why you should consider Split for your next web project:

## Inspired by a Passion for Web Development

Split Stack was born out of a deep passion for web development and a refusal to settle for the ordinary. Inspired by other remarkable projects like [create-t3-app](https://create.t3.gg/)  and [Astro's CLI](https://astro.build/) , the creators of Split Stack set out to craft the ultimate starting point for modern web applications. If you're eager to harness the power of [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)  and embrace typesafety, Split Stack is your gateway to a better web development experience.

## The Power of TypeScript

JavaScript can be challenging, especially as your projects grow in complexity. Enter [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)  – the backbone of Split Stack. TypeScript empowers you to become a more proficient developer by providing real-time feedback as you code. It enforces data types, offers autocomplete in your code editor, and catches potential issues before they become problems. Whether you're a web development novice or a seasoned pro, TypeScript's rigor promises a more enjoyable, consistent coding journey than plain JavaScript.

## SvelteKit: A Game-Changer

We love React, but sometimes it can lead us down complicated paths. That's where [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)  comes in. SvelteKit provides a fresh and efficient approach to web development. It offers an opinionated yet flexible solution to building web applications using Svelte, a JavaScript framework that compiles to highly optimized JavaScript during build. With SvelteKit's routing, API definitions, and image rendering, you can trust it to guide you toward best practices while keeping your development experience smooth.

## Embrace Modular Technologies

At Split Stack, we believe in simplicity, but we also recognize the value of essential technologies. We've carefully selected a set of technologies commonly used in web projects, making it easy for you to adopt the pieces you need:

### Zod for Data Validation

### Prisma: The SQL Supercharger

[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)  is to SQL what TypeScript is to JavaScript. It simplifies database operations by generating types from a user-defined schema that's compatible with multiple databases. Prisma guarantees end-to-end type safety, from your database to your application, making your interactions with the database smoother and safer.

### Lucia: Secure Authentication and Authorization
