# Split Stack: A Next-Generation Web Development Experience

Welcome to the world of Split, the web development stack that redefines how you build modern web applications. Split is a cutting-edge solution designed for those seeking the perfect balance between server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR). With Split, you'll harness the power of a robust set of technologies, including SvelteKit, TypeScript, Prisma, Lucia, Tailwind CSS, and optional Socket.IO integration using Express.

## The Split CLI Tool

So, what is the Split CLI tool, and how does it fit into your development workflow?

The Split CLI is your trusted companion for creating Split-powered projects. It's more than just a template; it's a dynamic CLI built to streamline the setup of your modular Split Stack app. Here's what you need to know:

**Modularity**: Each component of the Split Stack puzzle is optional. The CLI generates a tailored project template based on your specific needs.

**Opinionated Insights**: Split CLI includes our humble opinions on things like configuration files for chosen technologies, CSS styles, and custom handlers.

**Your Unique Solution**: We don't dictate all aspects of your application. While we provide a solid foundation, we encourage you to bring your own libraries and solutions to address your application's unique challenges.

## Split-Stack Axioms

As you embark on your journey with Split, it's important to understand the guiding principles that shape our decisions and project direction. These are the Split Stack axioms:

### Type safety is a must

Creating a type-safe web application is not a luxury; it's a necessity. Split is committed to improving productivity and minimizing bugs by prioritizing type safety. Any decision that compromises type safety belongs to a different project.

### Minimalism

We designed Split to address the significant challenges in building a modern web app, not to encompass every possible aspect. Split CLI contains everything needed to solve problems related to its core technologies. While we don't directly provide solutions for things like UI libraries, we do offer some recommendations.

### Bleeding Edge is tricky

Bleeding-edge technologies are fantastic; they offer a great developer experience with exceptional performance. However, they are riskier to work with since they are relatively new. Split has carefully considered this risk and has chosen, after testing, the right technologies for its core stack.
