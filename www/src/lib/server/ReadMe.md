# Introduction

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional static types to the language. When used in conjunction with SvelteKit, a modern web framework for building fast, optimized websites, TypeScript can offer a range of benefits that enhance the development process and the quality of your code.

## Benefits of TypeScript in SvelteKit

### Static Type Checking

TypeScript provides compile-time type checking, which helps catch errors early in the development process. This leads to fewer runtime errors and better code quality. With TypeScript, you can explicitly define the types of variables, function parameters, and return values, making your codebase more robust and maintainable.
